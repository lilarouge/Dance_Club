# Dance_Club
 I am part of collective regrouping dancers from TLV and we are trying to open the freelancer network and change the competitive secret and elitist way the dance world works.​
We are trying to build a community that will be an exclusive platform for the dancers and from the dancers. The content will offer exclusive informations, exchange, collaborations and  job opportunities.

I will create a webSite responsive including:​

A profile (log in, creation of a profile and password)

The forum will have 3 categories with an option to write content or questions and answer it.

Every question or answer writen by the user is stored in their profile.

Terminology

juridical section: This category will contain questions or informations about juridical concerns: how much should I be payed for working, how to get a working visa, how to find a lawyer to help me with administrative things….
inspiration section: This category will contain video links, pictures, questions, debates linked with art, and culture, raising awareness for new topics, asking for creation advices, sharing the work of one and another.
audition section: This category will contain all the audition related posts. Advertising for people looking for dancers or performers for specific projects.
